<div class="notice">This post was first published on my personal WordPress.com blog. It was migrated here for historical reasons (and because I am a compulsive completionist) and may have been edited from its original form and content.</div>

I've been unemployed for a month now. After two weeks of taking it easy (and a brief and strange foray into the mad world of contracting at a Large Financial Institution™) I have finally begun my studies in earnest. The finances are in place; I am secure for much longer than I plan to study. Current goal is to find a great employer by November or to get any programming job if I can't find a desirable job by January.

My plans for July are the following:

*   Develop a functional prototype of MemoryTyper that may be adapted to become the web component of the mobile app Remember Me
*   Develop my website [jonas.ninja](jonas.ninja) and migrate my tech posts from here
*   Read the HTTP, HTML, and CSS specifications (this is the one I'm most excited about. I'm a nerd like that)
*   Become reasonably well-versed in the new ES6 features
*   Read one technical book, [Universal Principles of Design](https://books.google.com/books?id=l0QPECGQySYC) and [Design of Everyday Things](https://books.google.com/books?id=w8pM72p_dpoC)
*   Review [SPD1](https://www.edx.org/course/systematic-program-design-part-1-core-ubcx-spd1x) (I took this a long time ago in Coursera, would like to refresh)
*   Gain a greater awareness of the [items in my master list](https://thoughtsfromwhence.wordpress.com/2015/03/15/becoming-a-front-end-developer-diary-4/) so I can make more informed decisions about future study plans
*   Improve my keyboarding speed from 60-80 to 80-100 words per minute (why is my speed so low?)
*   Finally finish [IIPP](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython1) (just for fun. This will be my fifth or sixth attempt. I keep missing deadlines accidentally)
Future plans involve actually turning MemoryTyper into Remember Me, taking the follow-up courses to IIPP and SPD, and reading yet more books. This is the boring stuff, but I feel it needs to be done now. The exciting stuff comes in the following months: a review of [Startup Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/course/startup), a read of [Interaction Design](http://www.amazon.com/Interaction-Design-Beyond-Human-Computer/dp/0470665769) (which I've been wanting to read since I was forced to drop the class back in university), [Soft Skills](http://www.manning.com/sonmez/), and things like that.

I hope to put out more frequent updates to chronicle my progress. I'm considering using the [Codepen blog](http://codepen.io/jonas_ninja/blog/) instead for code-specific posts and leave other technical topics, but I have legal concerns about the content I put on there. Whoops, sorry, I just said something boring again. It keeps happening.
