You can do a lot of interesting color manipulation now without JavaScript. Here is a terrific demo of what you can do with new CSS property `mix-blend-mode`. Just click in the image and pick a new color for the VW Beetle.

[MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode), which list other possible values besides "hue." Try playing around with other values in the Pen above, or with your browser's dev tools. 

If you're thinking that "mix" and "blend" are almost redundant, well... your're right, but that awkward name differentiates this property from `background-blend-mode`. 

**Fun fact!** This is not a CSS3 property, but is defined in a separate specification: [Compositing and Blending Level 1](https://drafts.fxtf.org/compositing-1/#mix-blend-mode).
