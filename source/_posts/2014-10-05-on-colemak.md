So I'm learning the Colemak keyboard layout. I'm typing this post at a blistering 15 words per minute, but it feels like 15 words per hour. It's like learning to type all over again, because it _is_. But I don't remember it being this painful. Despite the excellent practice that this blog post provides me, I'll have to cut it short so I don't go crazy. Gah! Ghur ur rgl;us.
